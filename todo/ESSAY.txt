	The state is a set of factors that determine the component's present state. A component's state is internal, meaning that it is specified and modifiable exclusively within the component. Any change in state causes the component to be rendered again.Property is abbreviated as props. It's the set of attributes that a parent component sends to a child component. These can be functions or data variables.
